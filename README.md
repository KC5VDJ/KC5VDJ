- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KC5VDJ, Amateur Extra for over two decades, supergeek, -... .-.. .- .... .-.-.-

I think the repositories I have going should keep me busy for a while.

Due to our situation, work here will be sporadic.  I am writing a book and trying get justice for some seriously evil shit that was done in the name of Jesus by Texastanis against my wife and then third trimester daughter, targeting my daughter for death for Jesus, fucking twice.  We are having to live under dismal living conditions.  I use this as decompression.

I'm a former DFL CD Director, a clump of cells in a test tube isn't a child.  Third fucking Trimester fucking is.  If we don't win big, civil war is long overdue, and I support it.  I have been greatly motivated to support such a war.  I don't think they are fixable as people, war is the only option.

Sixty years ago, Malcolm X noted that they are incapable of positive moral change.  The proof is in the pudding, and the pudding has been cooked and ready for millennia.  Welcome to 2024.  Malcolm X was right.  War is the only cure.  RBS is why education does not work, RBS has been known about for two decades now. Trying to educate them in morality is completely ineffective accorfing to functional MRI, it only reinforces their bullshit, and is ween as an attack.  War is the only option.
